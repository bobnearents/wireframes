      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>With work experience ranging from manufacturing to corporate sales, I've had practice solving a diverse array of
      problems. In any situation of life I strive to be learning something. Whether it be rules to a new board game, or the
      latest Javascript library. I thrive when I'm working with a team of passionate people who care about the quality of
      their work</p>
